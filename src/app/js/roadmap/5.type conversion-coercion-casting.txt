Coercion is an automatic type conversion that occurs in JavaScript when you want to perform certain operations.

Type conversion can either be implicit (automatically done during code execution) or explicit (done by you the developer).

Implicit Type Conversion is also known (and more commonly referred to) as "Coercion" while Explicit Type Conversion is also known as "Type Casting".

Implicit Type Conversion - coercion : const sum = 35 + "hello"
Explicit Type Conversion - type Casting : const numberConvert = String(number)
