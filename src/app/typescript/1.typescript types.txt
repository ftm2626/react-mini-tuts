A.primitive types
    1.boolean
    2.number
    3.string
    4.void : when functions do not return a value
    5.undefined : undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. variable has not yet been initialized.
        let title:string; -> this is undefined
    6.null : null is assigned to the value. it might be an optional value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
        let title:string = null;
B.object types
    1.interface
    2.class
    3.enums
    4.array
    5.tuple
C.other types
    1.any : disables any type checking.
    2.object
    3.unknown :all possible values are excepted and type checking is not disabled
        if(typeof val === "number") val++;
    4.never : no possible value. can build your own complex type.
        type A = number & string -> this is evaluated as never. you can't have both.
