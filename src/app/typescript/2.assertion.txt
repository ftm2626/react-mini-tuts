Type assertion allows you to set the type of a value and tell the compiler not to infer it. This is when you, as a programmer, might have a better understanding of the type of a variable than what TypeScript can infer on its own. 

let code: any = 123; 
let employeeCode = <number> code; 
console.log(typeof(employeeCode)); //Output: number
